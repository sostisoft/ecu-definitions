Audi A3 1.9 TDI - EDC15/EDC16 XDF Definition File Research
============================================================
Date: 2026-02-28

TARGET ECUs
-----------

2. Bosch EDC15P+  - ASZ (130hp), ATD (100hp), AXR (101hp)  [PD = Pumpe Duse]
3. Bosch EDC16    - BKC/BLS/BXE (105hp)          [later PD engines, mk5 platform]

Common VAG ECU part numbers:
  EDC15V:  038906012A, 038906012M, 038906012BD (ALH)
  EDC15P+: 038906019xx series (ASZ/ATD/AXR)

FINDINGS SUMMARY
================

STATUS: No freely downloadable, ready-to-use XDF files were found for these
specific ECUs on GitHub or public download pages. However, a free open-source
tool (VAGEDCSuite) CAN GENERATE XDF files from your BIN dump.


FREE RESOURCES FOUND & DOWNLOADED
==================================

1. VAGEDCSuite (FREE - Open Source, generates XDF from BIN)

   What it does:
     - Opens EDC15P, EDC15P+, EDC15V, EDC15C, EDC15M, EDC16, EDC17 BIN files
     - Automatically locates maps (driver wish, torque limiter, smoke limiter,
       boost target, N75, SOI, duration, EGR, etc.)
     - Has "File > Export XDF" function to generate TunerPro-compatible XDF
     - Validates and corrects checksums

2. EDCSuiteOnline (FREE - Open Source, web-based)
   Repository: https://github.com/ayyo42069/edcsuiteonline
   What it does: Browser-based tool for EDC15P+ ECU files
   Limitation: Limited mappack database compared to desktop version, no XDF export

3. ecu-tool (FREE - Open Source)
   Repository: https://github.com/fjvva/ecu-tool
   What it does: Arduino-based ECU flash read/write tool
   Contains: VAGEDCSuite.msi installer and VAG EDC15 Maps.pdf
   Supports: EDC15P/P+, EDC15V, EDC15VM+, EDC16U31/U34

4. Template XDF (Created as part of this research)
   File: EDC15P_1.9TDI_PD_template.xdf
   WARNING: Contains PLACEHOLDER addresses (0x0). Must be populated with
   correct addresses from your specific BIN using VAGEDCSuite.
   Maps included: Driver Wish, Torque Limiter, Smoke Limiter, Boost Target,
   N75 Duty Cycle, Boost Limiter, SVBL, SOI, Duration, SOI Limiter,
   EGR, Idle RPM, MAF Linearization, MAF Temp Correction

RECOMMENDED APPROACH
====================

For EDC15P+ (ASZ/ATD/AXR) - Best free option:
  1. Read your ECU BIN file using ecu-tool or similar OBD flasher
  2. Open BIN in VAGEDCSuite (free, open source)
  3. VAGEDCSuite will auto-detect map locations
  4. Use File > Export XDF to generate a TunerPro-compatible XDF
  5. Open in TunerPro RT (free) for editing

For EDC15V (ALH/AHF) - Best free option:
  1. Same as above - VAGEDCSuite supports EDC15V variant
  2. Note: ALH/AHF use VP37 injection pump, different from PD engines
  3. Map structure differs from EDC15P+ but same tool works

For EDC16 (BKC/BLS/BXE) - More limited free options:
  1. VAGEDCSuite has EDC16 parser (EDC16FileParser.cs) but it's less mature
  2. The tool's EDC16 XDF export was noted as "5% complete" in the code
  3. May need paid damos from autodtc.net (EUR 90) for complete coverage
  4. Alternative: Use WinOLS with purchased damos/A2L files

Known map addresses for 038906012BD (ALH EDC15V) from ecuedit.com:
  - EGR 01:           $59820 (16x13) [also at $65820, $71820 in other banks]
  - Driver Wish:      $5c1b4 (12x8)
  - Smoke Limiter:    $5c9cc (16x10)
  - Boost Target:     $5af60 (16x10)
  - N75 Duty Cycle:   varies (16x13)
  - Torque Limiter:   varies (3x19)
  Note: Addresses are for this SPECIFIC part number only. Other ALH ECUs
  will have different addresses.
